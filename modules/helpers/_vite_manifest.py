"""Vite manifest lookup for the ``asset_url`` Jinja helper.

Roadmap #1334 Step 4 (activation phase). This module reads the manifest
that ``vite build`` produces at ``static/dist/.vite/manifest.json`` and
resolves a source-file name (e.g. ``000-base``) to the hashed built
filename (e.g. ``000-base-DKccW2Od.js``).

The manifest is loaded once, at first lookup, and cached in module
scope. If Vite writes a new manifest (e.g. during a live development
loop with ``npm run build`` in a watch flow), ``reload_manifest()``
clears the cache. Production Flask processes never call
``reload_manifest`` -- the manifest is baked at container/binary
build time.

Two shipping-vector realities to know about:

- **Source checkout / dev**: ``static/dist/`` is gitignored. If nobody
  runs ``npm run build``, the manifest doesn't exist. ``asset_url()``
  falls back to ``/static/local-js/<name>.js`` so ``python quickstart.py``
  after a fresh clone still works.

- **Docker / PyInstaller / release binary**: a follow-up PR will run
  ``npm run build`` in the packaging step, producing a populated
  ``static/dist/`` inside the shipped image. The manifest resolves and
  clients get hashed, minified bundles.

The manifest schema (Vite 8.x) looks like::

    {
      "static/local-js/000-base.js": {
        "file": "000-base-DKccW2Od.js",
        "src":  "static/local-js/000-base.js",
        "isEntry": true,
        ...
      },
      "_validationPageBase-CfgGMyYr.js": {
        "file": "chunks/validationPageBase-CfgGMyYr.js",
        "name": "validationPageBase"
      }
    }

Entry files (the ones templates load via ``<script src=...>``) have
their source path as the key. Shared chunks have an ``_`` prefix and
are only referenced transitively via ``imports`` fields on entries;
this module doesn't need to look them up directly.
